# ðŸŽ¥ FilmGenerator

## An Overview

Small terminal based application to generate a random film title from a bank of film titles. The ability to add to that film bank is also avaliable. 

## Why did I build it?
I got bored, small little project I could use personally to generate a film title if I couldn't make a decesion for myself on what to watch.

P.S. SORRY FOR THE MESSY CODE, NEED TO FIX 

**THINGS TO DO**<br>
`add switch statement based menu`
<br>
`make flow of the application more efficient`
