# ðŸŽ¥ FilmGenerator

## An Overview

Small terminal based application to generate a random film title from a bank of film titles. The ability to add to that film bank is also avaliable. 

## Why did I build it?
I wasn't sure on what movies to watch so I thought I would put all of my favourite films into a bank of film titles which I love to re-watch now and then and let it randomly choose for me without me having to think what to watch.
